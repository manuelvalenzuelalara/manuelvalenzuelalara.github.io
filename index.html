        <h1>My very Finnish Christmas</h1>
        <h2>A story by Manuel Valenzuela</h2>
        <p>As in every December, the days previous to Christmas are always of contained excitement. The anticipation
of making the trip to meet our friends and family grows with every day that passes. We buy the gifts that we will
give them (with no clue if they will like them or not), we discuss what food we will want served at the table on
Christmas Eve and we can't stop thinking of all the activities we will do while in vacation.<br><br>

For me, Christmas 2017 was all of this and a little bit more. <br><br>

For the first time in my life I was going to spend Christmas away from Mexico. Away from all the traditions I know and away from all the family and friends I left behind. My girlfriend and I were planning to go to northern Finland, to a little but beautiful town called Ivalo, where her hometown is. And I could not imagined how wonderful times I was about to experience there. <br><br>

We started our journey on December 22nd. Joined by my girlfriend's sister and her boyfriend we depart form Oulu at noon. We had made this trip before, later in September, but this felt different. It is a six to seven hour trip by car, adorned by the most vast pine forest you could ever see. On top of this, and as we were traveling in winter, the whole landscape was brushed with the white of snow that never seized to fell. A beautiful road.<br><br>

In the middle of the trip I found myself in a very special spot. Frequented by tourists of all nationalities, but mainly Asians and British, "Santa's House" appears in the side of the road as soon as you cross the Arctic Circle. I can imagine how magical could it be for a kid to visit this place. Delivering your wish card to the Post office and seeing reel reindeers pull sledges, watching Santa's helpers wraping gifts and sitting in Santa's lap. The real Santa! Even for me was touching. It was a perfect prelude for the Christmas I was about to have.<br><br>

By the time we arrived at Ivalo it was already dark. In fact it has been dark for the past 5 hours, as in winter Finland only gets from 3 to 5 hours of sunlight each day, depending on how in the north you are. We arrived home to a familiar sound. Boris and Olga were welcoming us with loud barks and howls. The family dogs are one of a kind. Olga is a 9 months old German shepard who works for the Border control and Boris is a Jack Russell type of hunting dog who is always in the mood for cuddling and playing.<br><br>

Although we arrived tired our welcome couldn't have been more warm and cheerful.
